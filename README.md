# [Project 1](https://share.streamlit.io/cl500coupe/gender_recognition_app/main/app.py)
Face detection and Gender recognition web application hosted on streamlit.io.
I used 18000 images of faces split into two categories (man,woman). Each image is 180 by 180 pixels.
Keras Sequential model with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D layers was build on dataset that was previously autotuned and normalised.
Validation accuracy fluctuates between 89-92%.

Training procees is using Convolutional Neural Networks is shared [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maciejgronczynski/cnn-sequential-gender-recognition-model)

Disclaimer: All data used to train and test my Convolutional Neural Networks model was collected
by myself and it's public and free to use on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maciejgronczynski/biggest-genderface-recognition-dataset)

Dataset and model were collected and trained by myself.
